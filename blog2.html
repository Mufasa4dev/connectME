                            <p>Take initiative
                                Today's career requirements are highly developed and require much more than someone who
                                won't take risks.
                                In today's competitive career landscape, employers are looking for individuals who can
                                bring fresh ideas to
                                the table and take initiative, start new projects, pitch new solutions and create new
                                opportunities for the
                                business.

                            <h6 style="font-weight: bolder; margin-top: 20px;">Be your own evaluator</h6>
                            <p>One of the best ways to achieve career success is to keep assessing your performance.
                                Don't wait for your annual appraisal – do it yourself. An ideal way to do this would be
                                to identify
                                quantifiable goals and set a timeline for achieving them. Start with setting short-term
                                goals when you're
                                new to a job. Create a detailed plan to achieve these goals. Break the tasks down into
                                weekly or even daily
                                tasks and fill out a small form at the end of the week to assess where you're headed and
                                whether you need to
                                change your strategy. You can even show your own performance report to your managers at
                                some point to show
                                how you've progressed. This will show that you understand the importance of constant
                                self-evaluation and
                                improvement.

                                <p>Be ready to learn
                                    To excel in your career, you have to be willing to learn. No matter what university
                                    you
                                    graduated from or what grades you had, professional life will be very different from
                                    college. Be prepared to have a million questions pop up every day regarding what
                                    you're
                                    doing. It might take you days to get a hang of your duties at your new job,
                                    so show management that you are coachable, paying attention and always willing to
                                    learn
                                    new things.
                                    <p>

                                        <p>Anticipate needs
                                            To succeed in your new job and achieve career success,
                                            you will have to be well aware of what your manager needs.
                                            Stay a step ahead of your boss by asking yourself, “If I were my boss,
                                            what would I want done next?” By making sure you get things efficiently done
                                            in time,
                                            and take the initiative to do them yourself, you will be showing a positive,
                                            go-getter
                                            attitude to higher management.</p>
                                        <h6 style="font-weight: bolder; margin-top: 20px;">Communicate well</h6>
                                        <p> Communicate well
                                            Communication is key to an employee's and an organization's success.
                                            If your manager has to ask you for a status report, you're not doing
                                            everything you
                                            could
                                            be doing. The idea is to proactively communicate and let them know when a
                                            task is done,
                                            and move on to what needs to be done next.
                                        </p>
                                        <h6 style="font-weight: bolder; margin-top: 20px;">Set goals to achieve</h6>
                                        <p>Set goals to achieve
                                            Remember you're not being paid for 'working hard' or 'staying busy.'
                                            At the end of the day, what matters to your employer is how you're
                                            contributing to
                                            fulfilling
                                            he company's goals and mission, both short term and long term. Therefore,
                                            keep in mind
                                            that
                                            you're being paid to deliver on clearly defined goals that significantly
                                            impact the
                                            company's
                                            performance and overall mission and vision. This goal-oriented mindset will
                                            help you
                                            achieve
                                            career success, no matter where you are on the corporate ladder.</p>

                                        <p>The value of action is far greater than that of mere words. Use this as a

                                            your dealings at the office. Instead of bragging about all the things you
                                            can do, and
                                            then never actually delivering, you ought to show management what you are
                                            capable of.

                                        <h6 style="font-weight: bolder; margin-top: 20px;">Gain Trust</h6>
                                        <p>Gain trust
                                            This is one of the most important tips for success you need to ensure
                                            success when you
                                            start a new job.
                                            Think of it this way: the quicker you earn your boss' trust, the sooner
                                            they'll have
                                            less to worry about
                                            and hence more free time to focus their attention on other pressing matters.
                                            If your
                                            boss finds you
                                            trustworthy, they'll delegate tasks to you. Make sure you meet your
                                            deadlines and keep
                                            your promises.
                                            It's critical, especially early on in your relationship with your boss,
                                            that you fulfill every commitment you make, no matter how difficult it may
                                            seem.</p>
                                        <h6 style="font-weight: bolder; margin-top: 20px;">Create Solutions</h6>
                                        <p> Create solutions
                                            Everyone can turn their problems into their manager's problems. Be the

                                            provider, not the problem creator. Great employees solve problems. If you
                                            don't have the
                                            authority to give the final verdict on a problem relevant to your work or
                                            department,
                                            then make sure you offer solutions to your boss and try to help as much as
                                            you can,
                                            wholeheartedly.</p>
